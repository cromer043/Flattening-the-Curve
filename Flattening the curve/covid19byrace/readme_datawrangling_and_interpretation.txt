DATA WRANGLING:
(See /data/ folder for .R files).
From Census microdata we list anyone who identifies as Hispanic as an ethnicity as Hispanic, regardless of race and combine other and 2+ races as "other", we do not display the other or 2+ race categories in our visualization. Then, from the microdata, the percentage of each racial category by state is calculated with a weighted percentage function. From the CDC BRFSS Survey data, the percentage of each racial category with preexisting conditions is similarly calculated (except for "senior", which is also calculated using Census Microdata). The preexisting conditions ratio is calculated by dividing the percentage of the state population of each preexisting condition by the percentage of the total state population (any number greater than one signifies that race disproportionately has that preexisting condition).

From the Census American Community Survey (ACS) state level data, we isolated estimates for counts of all people who identify as the following race/ethnicity (RE) groups (including those who classify themselves under two or more races): American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI), and White. The estimated counts for each RE group were then divided by the state population to calculate the percent population for each RE group in each state. These RE percentages total to over 100% due to overlap. From the Racial Data Tracker Dataset, we then isolated the COVID-19 case and death counts for each state as well as their RE breakdowns. The state-level case/death counts for the RE groups isolated from the ACS data were divided by the total state case/death counts and scaled to calculate percent of cases/deaths for each state that belong to the specified RE groups. The percent cases/deaths for each state and RE group were then divided by the state population percentages for each RE group from the ACS data to obtain the case/death ratios used to determine disproportionation of COVID-19 to different racial/ethnic groups.

INTERPRETATION:
Racial and ethnic minorities are facing disproportionate cases and deaths due to COVID-19. However, there are inconsistencies in state COVID-19 reporting, such as the multitude of cases with unknown racial/ethnic classification and differences in racial categorization schemes, along with inconsistencies in the beta-released Racial Data Tracker. These inconsistencies make it difficult to make strong claims about effects on specific communities (primarily the American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities). As we continue to fight this pandemic, Congress must demand that states consistently report COVID-19 demographic data.

There are a wide range of outcomes for preexisting conditions between states. For states attempting to prevent COVID-19 or future pandemics from taking a heavier toll on vulnerable communities, they must address the inequitable social structures that lead to imbalanced health outcomes within their states. This cannot be a one size fits all model as each state combats different health disparities.
